    <h2>ABOUT ME:</h2> 
 My name is Idan Schmidt, and I'm currently studying to become a professional Software Tester (QA) at John Bryce College. <br>
I'm in the middle of a QA course and already certified with ISTQB Foundation Level.<br>
I'm highly motivated to grow in the tech field, and I'm eager to keep learning and expanding my skills — including automated testing and advanced QA methodologies.<br>
I believe that quality is never an accident – it’s the result of careful testing, curiosity, and constant learning.
That’s what I bring to every project.<br>
